  1850 CENSUS FORM STRUCTURE:

  *** REVOLUTIONARY CENSUS - First to name EVERY PERSON! ***

  Before 1850, only heads of household were named with statistical tallies.
  This is the first census to record names of all household members.

  HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
  - Major reform in census methodology
  - First time women and children named individually
  - Separate slave schedules existed (list by owner's name, not enslaved person's name)
  - Birthplace for each person recorded for first time

  KEY FEATURES:
  - NO enumeration districts (use page number only)
  - NO relationship column (must infer family structure from order)
  - First census with individual names for everyone
  - Occupation only for males over 15
  - No personal estate value (added in 1860)

  COLUMN LAYOUT:
  - Col 1-2: Dwelling and family numbers
  - Col 3-6: Name, age, sex, race (color)
  - Col 7-8: Occupation, real estate value
  - Col 9: Birthplace
  - Col 10-13: Marriage, school, literacy, disabilities

  READING TIPS:
  - Head of household is typically first person listed
  - Wife usually second, children by age
  - Servants/boarders typically listed after family
  - Real estate value indicates land ownership
  - For enslaved persons, check separate Slave Schedule
  - Names may be harder to read due to older handwriting styles
