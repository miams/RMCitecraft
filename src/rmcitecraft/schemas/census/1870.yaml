  - First census to count ALL persons equally (former slaves included)
  - Chinese laborers being enumerated in West
  - Includes male voting rights questions (15th Amendment just ratified)

  KEY FEATURES:
  - NO enumeration districts (use page number only)
  - NO relationship to head of household (not asked until 1880)
  - Father/mother foreign born (not actual birthplace)
  - Voting rights questions for males

  COLUMN LAYOUT:
  - Col 1-2: Dwelling and family numbers
  - Col 3-6: Name, age, sex, race
