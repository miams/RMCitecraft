  1880 CENSUS FORM STRUCTURE:

  The 1880 census has 50 lines per sheet side (A/B).

  MAJOR INNOVATIONS (all FIRST time asked):
  - Enumeration Districts (EDs) introduced
  - Relationship to head of household
  - Birthplace of father
  - Birthplace of mother
  - Marital status

  COLUMN LAYOUT:
  - Col 1-2: Dwelling number, family number
  - Col 3-5: Name, race (color), sex
  - Col 6-7: Age, month of birth (if born within year)
  - Col 8-10: Relationship, marital status, married within year
  - Col 11-12: Occupation, months unemployed
  - Col 13-18: Health/disability questions
  - Col 19-21: Education (school, reading, writing)
  - Col 22-24: Birthplace, father's birthplace, mother's birthplace

  READING TIPS:
  - First census to use enumeration districts - critical for citations
  - Relationship column is GOLD - establishes family structure
  - Parents' birthplaces help trace immigration/migration
  - "Mulatto" used as race category
  - Literacy columns are "cannot read/write" (inverted from later censuses)
