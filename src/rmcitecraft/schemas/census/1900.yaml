  1900 CENSUS FORM STRUCTURE:

  The 1900 census has 50 lines per sheet side (A/B).

  KEY FEATURES:
  - Only census to record birth month AND year (very valuable!)
  - "Mulatto" dropped as race category
  - Number of years in US asked
  - Children born/living for women

  COLUMN LAYOUT:
  - Col 1-4: Location
  - Col 5-6: Name, relationship
  - Col 7-12: Sex, race, birth month/year, age, marital status
  - Col 13-15: Years married, children born/living
  - Col 16-18: Birthplace, parents' birthplaces
  - Col 19-21: Immigration, years in US, naturalization
  - Col 22-23: Occupation, months unemployed
  - Col 24-27: Education and English
  - Col 28-30: Home ownership

  READING TIPS:
  - Birth month/year is GOLD for genealogy - only census to have this
  - Years married helps estimate marriage date
  - "Children born" vs "children living" indicates child mortality
