  1840 CENSUS FORM STRUCTURE:

  ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Only HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD is named.
  All other household members are statistical tallies by age/sex category.

  This is the LAST census before the 1850 reform that named everyone.

  SPECIAL FEATURES:
  - Revolutionary War pensioner names recorded (valuable!)
  - Employment categories by industry
  - School attendance counted
  - Literacy counted

  DATA AVAILABLE:
  - Head of household name
  - Counts of persons by age brackets and sex
  - Counts of free colored and slaves
  - Employment statistics
  - Pensioner names

  DATA NOT AVAILABLE:
  - Individual names of family members
  - Ages of specific individuals
  - Birthplaces
  - Relationships

  CITATION FORMAT:
  "[Head of Household], 1840 U.S. census, [County], [State], p. [page]; NARA M704."

  READING TIPS:
  - Revolutionary War pensioner column is genealogically valuable
  - Age brackets help estimate individual ages
  - Slave counts on same schedule as free household
