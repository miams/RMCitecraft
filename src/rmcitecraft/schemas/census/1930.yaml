  - name: street_name
    column_number: 1
    data_type: string
    description: "Street name"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides moderate value for locating the exact residence. Street addresses help identify property records, city directories, and enable research in Sanborn fire insurance maps to understand living conditions."

  - name: house_number
    column_number: 2
    data_type: string
    description: "House number"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides moderate value when combined with street name for precise address identification. Specific addresses connect to property deeds, tax records, city directories, and historical photographs of the neighborhood."

  - name: dwelling_number
    column_number: 3
    data_type: integer
    description: "Dwelling number in order of visitation"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides minimal genealogical value beyond census navigation. Dwelling numbers help distinguish between families at the same address in multi-family buildings."

  - name: family_number
    column_number: 4
    data_type: integer
    description: "Family number in order of visitation"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides minimal genealogical value beyond census navigation. When dwelling and family numbers differ, it reveals multiple families sharing a residence, common during economic hardship."

  - name: name
    column_number: 5
    data_type: string
    description: "Full name as written"
    required: true
    genealogical_value: "Holds exceptional value as the primary identifier linking records across sources. Name variations, nicknames, and spelling differences recorded here help identify the same person in other documents. Middle names or initials not found elsewhere may distinguish between individuals with common names."

  - name: relationship
    column_number: 6
    data_type: string
    description: "Relationship to head of household"
    required: true
    genealogical_value: "Holds exceptional value for establishing family structure and connections. Relationships reveal parent-child links, identify in-laws, distinguish stepchildren from biological children, and uncover extended family members like grandparents, aunts, uncles, or cousins living in the household."

  - name: home_owned_rented
    column_number: 7
    data_type: string
    description: "O=Owned, R=Rented"
    valid_values: ["O", "R"]
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides moderate insight into economic status and stability. Home ownership indicates financial resources and suggests property records exist; renting may explain more frequent moves and absence from property tax records."

  - name: home_value_or_rent
    column_number: 8
    data_type: string
    description: "Value if owned, monthly rent if rented"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Offers significant insight into economic circumstances before the Depression. Property values and rent levels indicate relative wealth within the community, help compare living standards across family branches, and provide a baseline before economic collapse."

  - name: radio_set
    column_number: 9
    data_type: string
    description: "R=Yes has radio set"
    valid_values: ["R", ""]
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides limited but interesting insight into household modernity and economic status. Radio ownership in 1930 indicated middle-class status and connection to broader culture; the 1930 census was the only one to ask this question."

  - name: farm
    column_number: 10
    data_type: string
    description: "F=Lives on farm"
    valid_values: ["F", ""]
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides moderate value for understanding lifestyle and potential record sources. Farm residence indicates agricultural schedules may exist with detailed farming information, and suggests USDA records, agricultural extension records, or farm organization memberships."

  - name: sex
    column_number: 11
    data_type: string
    description: "M=Male, F=Female"
    valid_values: ["M", "F"]
    required: true
    genealogical_value: "Provides limited but essential value for distinguishing individuals with ambiguous names. Sex confirms identity when correlating records and helps resolve cases where names like Marion, Leslie, or Pat could belong to either gender."

  - name: race
    column_number: 12
    data_type: string
    description: "W=White, Neg=Negro, etc."
    valid_values: ["W", "Neg", "Mex", "In", "Ch", "Jp", "Fil", "Hin", "Kor"]
    required: true
    genealogical_value: "Provides significant context for understanding ancestral heritage and identifying specialized record sets. The 1930 census uniquely included 'Mexican' as a race category; race designations point toward ethnic-specific records such as Freedmen's Bureau records, tribal enrollment records, or immigration records from specific regions."

  - name: age
    column_number: 13
    data_type: integer
    description: "Age at last birthday"
    required: true
    genealogical_value: "Holds exceptional value for calculating approximate birth year and confirming identity across records. Age serves as a primary matching criterion when linking census records, vital records, and other documents. Comparing ages across censuses reveals inconsistencies that may indicate age misreporting or identity confusion."

  - name: marital_status
    column_number: 14
    data_type: string
    description: "S=Single, M=Married, Wd=Widowed, D=Divorced"
    valid_values: ["S", "M", "Wd", "D"]
    required: true

  - name: age_at_first_marriage
    column_number: 15
    data_type: integer
    description: "Age at first marriage"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Holds significant value for calculating approximate first marriage date. Unlike later censuses that asked this only of sample persons, the 1930 census collected this for everyone, making it exceptionally useful for narrowing marriage record searches and identifying marriages that occurred before available vital records."

  - name: attended_school
    column_number: 16
    data_type: string
    description: "Yes/No attended school since Sept 1, 1929"
    valid_values: ["Yes", "No"]
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides limited value primarily for children and young adults. School attendance suggests school records, yearbooks, or graduation records may exist for that time period."

  - name: can_read_write
    column_number: 17
    data_type: string
    description: "Yes/No can read and write"
    valid_values: ["Yes", "No"]
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides moderate insight into educational background and life circumstances. Literacy indicates whether ancestors could sign documents, write letters, or read newspapers; illiteracy may explain reliance on marks instead of signatures and could point to language barriers for immigrants."

  - name: birthplace
    column_number: 18
    data_type: string
    description: "State if US, country if foreign"
    required: true
    genealogical_value: "Holds exceptional value for directing research to birth records and understanding migration patterns. State of birth narrows vital record searches; foreign birthplace indicates immigration records, ship manifests, and naturalization documents exist. Birthplace also reveals family migration before the individual's birth."

  - name: father_birthplace
    column_number: 19
    data_type: string
    description: "Father's birthplace"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Holds exceptional value for extending family research back one generation. Unlike the 1940 census which asked this only of sample persons, the 1930 census collected this for everyone. Father's birthplace identifies geographic origins for the paternal line, points toward immigration records if foreign-born, and helps confirm family connections."

  - name: mother_birthplace
    column_number: 20
    data_type: string
    description: "Mother's birthplace"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Holds exceptional value for extending family research back one generation. Unlike the 1940 census which asked this only of sample persons, the 1930 census collected this for everyone. Mother's birthplace identifies geographic origins for the maternal line and reveals potential maiden name origins based on ethnic communities."

  - name: mother_tongue
    column_number: 21
    data_type: string
    description: "Language spoken in home before coming to US"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides significant insight into ethnic heritage and immigration background. Mother tongue reveals the family's cultural origins, suggests specific regions within a country of origin, and may indicate communities or churches where earlier records exist. Languages like Yiddish, Low German, or regional dialects can pinpoint geographic origins more precisely than country of birth alone."

  - name: year_immigration
    column_number: 22
    data_type: integer
    description: "Year of immigration to US"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Holds exceptional value for locating immigration records. The immigration year narrows the search for ship passenger lists to a specific timeframe, identifies which port records to search, and helps calculate the immigrant's age at arrival for matching purposes."

  - name: naturalization
    column_number: 23
    data_type: string
    description: "Na=Naturalized, Pa=First papers, Al=Alien"
    valid_values: ["Na", "Pa", "Al"]
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides significant guidance for locating naturalization records. Naturalized status confirms court records exist with biographical details including birthplace, occupation, and physical description; first papers indicate a declaration of intention was filed; alien status suggests passport or visa records may be available."

  - name: can_speak_english
    column_number: 24
    data_type: string
    description: "Yes/No can speak English"
    valid_values: ["Yes", "No"]
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides moderate context for understanding immigrant experience and assimilation. English proficiency indicates how recently the person immigrated, their ability to participate in English-language organizations, and whether foreign-language newspapers and church records might contain information about them."

  - name: occupation
    column_number: 25
    data_type: string
    description: "Specific occupation"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Holds exceptional value for understanding an ancestor's skills, daily life, and social standing. Occupations reveal specialized training, point to union records or professional licensing, and suggest industry-specific archives. The 1930 occupation captures work before the Depression's worst impact."

  - name: industry
    column_number: 26
    data_type: string
    description: "Industry or business"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides significant context for occupation data. Industry identifies the type of employer, which may lead to company records, industry publications, or specialized archives like railroad records, mining company files, or manufacturing plant records."

  - name: class_of_worker
    column_number: 27
    data_type: string
    description: "W=Wage worker, E=Employer, O=Own account, NP=Unpaid family"
    valid_values: ["W", "E", "O", "NP"]
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides moderate insight into employment status and record sources. Employers might have business records; own-account workers suggest self-employment or small business ownership with potential business licenses or directories; unpaid family workers indicate family business involvement."

  - name: at_work_yesterday
    column_number: 28
    data_type: string
    description: "Yes/No at work yesterday"
    valid_values: ["Yes", "No"]
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides limited context for employment status. This question was asked just before the Depression's full impact, making 'No' answers potentially significant for understanding early economic hardship."

  - name: unemployment_schedule_line
    column_number: 29
    data_type: integer
    description: "Cross Reference to unemployment schedule line number if unemployed"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides moderate value by indicating an unemployment schedule exists with additional details. The 1930 unemployment schedule collected information about duration of unemployment and reasons, providing context for economic circumstances at the Depression's onset."

  - name: veteran
    column_number: 30
    data_type: string
    description: "Yes/No veteran of US military"
    valid_values: ["Yes", "No"]

  - name: war
    column_number: 31
    data_type: string
    description: "Which war: WW=World War, Sp=Spanish-Am, Civ=Civil, Phil=Philippine, Box=Boxer, Mex=Mexican"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Holds exceptional value for identifying specific military record sets. World War service points to draft registration cards and service records; Spanish-American War suggests pension files; Civil War indicates pension applications with rich biographical detail; Philippine, Boxer, or Mexican service reveals career military or specialized unit records."

  - name: farm_schedule
    column_number: 32
    data_type: string
    description: "Cross Reference to farm schedule if applicable"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides limited value but indicates a separate agricultural schedule exists that may contain detailed information about farm operations, acreage, crops, livestock, and equipment."
