  1930 CENSUS FORM STRUCTURE:

  The 1930 census has 50 lines per sheet side (A/B).

  KEY DIFFERENCES FROM LATER CENSUSES:
  - First census to ask about radio ownership
  - Age at first marriage asked
  - "Mexican" added as race category
  - Veterans status and war service recorded

  COLUMN LAYOUT:
  - Col 1-2: Street address
  - Col 3-4: Dwelling/family numbers
  - Col 5-6: Name, relationship to head
  - Col 7-10: Home ownership, value/rent, radio, farm
  - Col 11-15: Sex, race, age, marital status, age at first marriage
  - Col 16-17: School attendance, literacy
  - Col 18-24: Birthplace, parents' birthplaces, immigration, naturalization
  - Col 25-28: Occupation, industry, worker class, employment
  - Col 29-30: Veteran status and war

  READING TIPS:
  - Ditto marks common for surnames
  - Radio column marked "R" if household has radio
  - Mexican is listed as race category (controversial at time)
