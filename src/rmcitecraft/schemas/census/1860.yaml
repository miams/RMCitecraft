  1860 CENSUS FORM STRUCTURE:

  The 1860 census uses page numbers (not enumeration districts).

  HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
  - Last census before Civil War
  - Separate slave schedules existed (list enslaved by name of owner)
  - Value of personal estate added (wealth indicator)
  - Free persons of color enumerated

  KEY FEATURES:
  - NO enumeration districts (use page number only)
  - NO relationship column (not asked until 1880)
  - Personal estate value added (new)
  - "Mulatto" as race category

  COLUMN LAYOUT:
  - Col 1-2: Dwelling and family numbers
  - Col 3-6: Name, age, sex, race
  - Col 7-9: Occupation, real estate, personal estate
  - Col 10: Birthplace
  - Col 11-12: Married/school within year
  - Col 13-14: Literacy and disabilities

  READING TIPS:
  - Enslaved persons were on separate "Slave Schedule" by owner name
  - Personal estate value is new and indicates movable property
  - "Pauper" and "convict" classifications in disability column
  - No relationship given - must infer from family order
