  1950 CENSUS FORM STRUCTURE:

  The 1950 census form has 30 lines per page. Unlike 1940, it uses page numbers (not sheets A/B).
  In citations, the page number is referred to as "stamp" (e.g., "stamp 71").

  COLUMN LAYOUT (left to right):
  - Col 1: Street address (street name and house number combined)
  - Col 2: Serial number of dwelling unit
  - Col 3: Dwelling on farm? (Y or blank)
  - Col 4: Status (O=Owned, R=Rented, N=No cash rent)
  - Col 5: Value (if owned) or monthly rent
  - Col 6: NAME - Last name first for head, given names follow
  - Col 7: Relationship to head (Head, Wife, Son, Daughter, Lodger, etc.)
  - Col 8: Race (W=White, Neg=Negro, Ind=Indian, etc.)
  - Col 9: Sex (M/F)
  - Col 10: Age at last birthday
  - Col 11: Marital status (M=Married, Wd=Widowed, D=Divorced, Sep=Separated, S=Single)
  - Col 12: Birthplace (state if US, country if foreign)
  - Col 13: Citizenship (if foreign-born)
  - Col 14-17: Residence April 1, 1949
  - Col 18-21: Employment status
  - Col 22-24: Occupation, Industry, Class of worker
  - Col 25-26: Income 1949, Weeks worked 1949

  SAMPLE QUESTIONS:
  Every 5th person (lines 6, 11, 16, 21, 26) has additional questions on the right side:
  - Mother's birthplace, Father's birthplace
  - Highest grade of school completed
  - Mother tongue (language spoken in home in earliest childhood)
  - Veteran status (which war)
  - Duration of marriage (women only)
  - Children ever born (women only)

  CITATION FORMAT:
  The 1950 census uses "stamp" instead of "sheet" in citations:
  "1950 U.S. census, [County], [State], [Township], E.D. [ED], stamp [page], line [line]"

  IMPORTANT READING TIPS:
  - First census released digitally (2022), image quality varies
  - Names use ditto marks for same surname as previous line
  - Rural areas may have descriptive addresses instead of street numbers
  - Watch for Sample lines (6, 11, 16, 21, 26) which have extra data on right side
  - Common abbreviations: Wm=William, Jno=John, Jas=James, Jr=Junior, Sr=Senior
