# 1950 US Federal Census Schema
# The 1950 census returns to page numbers (not sheets) and uses "stamp" in citations

# =============================================================================
# FORM VARIANTS
# =============================================================================
# The 1950 census used multiple form variants. The extraction algorithm must
# handle these differently.
#
# FORM P1 - POPULATION AND HOUSING SCHEDULE (Standard)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - Used in most of the United States
# - 30 lines per page, one person per line
# - Sample lines (columns 21-33) asked additional questions of ~20% of population
# - KEY INSIGHT: There were 5 versions of Form P1, each with different sample lines:
#     Version A: Lines 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26
#     Version B: Lines 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27
#     Version C: Lines 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28
#     Version D: Lines 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29
#     Version E: Lines 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30
# - Sample persons should be identified by PRESENCE OF SAMPLE FIELD DATA
#   (columns 21-33), NOT by line number, since we cannot determine which
#   form version was used.
#
# FORM P3 - HOUSEHOLD FORM (Experimental)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - Used experimentally in parts of Ohio and Michigan
# - Structured by HOUSEHOLD rather than by line number
# - Each head of household has "Line Number 1" (not unique sequential lines)
# - Multiple households appear on the same page
# - Family relationships stored explicitly (Spouse, Child fields)
# - NO sample line questions - everyone answers all questions
# - FamilySearch structure groups family members under "Spouses and Children"
# - Each person has their own ARK ID that must be followed for full data
# - Citation identifies as "household form" (e.g., "citing household form...")
#
# IDENTIFYING FORM TYPE:
# - RootsMagic citations explicitly mention "household form" in the source name
# - FamilySearch records show "Others on This Record" for other households
# - Household forms show explicit "Spouse:" and "Child:" relationship fields
# - Standard P1 forms use "Relationship to Head" column values
#

  sides: null  # No A/B sides - just page numbers
  # NOTE: Sample lines varied by form version (5 versions of Form P1).
  # We determine sample persons by checking for sample field data (cols 21-33), not line number.
  # Household forms (P3) have no sample lines - everyone answers all questions.

  # Columns 1-6: Household location
  - name: street_name
    column_number: 1
    data_type: string
    description: "Street name"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides moderate value for placing families within specific neighborhoods and communities. Combined with city directories or Sanborn maps, street addresses can reveal proximity to churches, schools, workplaces, or relatives living nearby."

  - name: household_number
    column_number: 2
    data_type: integer
    description: "Serial number of household"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Offers minimal genealogical insight as an administrative reference number. Primarily useful for distinguishing multiple families at the same address or locating the original census image."

  - name: dwelling_number
    column_number: 3
    data_type: integer
    description: "Serial number of dwelling unit"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides minimal direct value but can indicate whether families lived in single-family homes versus multi-unit buildings such as apartments, boarding houses, or tenements."

  - name: is_dwelling_on_farm
    column_number: 4
    data_type: string
    description: "Y/yes=Yes lives on farm, blank/no=No"
    valid_values: ["Y", "yes", "no", ""]
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Offers limited value in distinguishing rural agricultural families from urban or town dwellers. This context helps explain occupational patterns and family lifestyles."

  - name: status_of_dwelling
    column_number: 4
    data_type: string
    description: "O=Owned, R=Rented, N=No cash rent"
    valid_values: ["O", "R", "N", "no", ""]
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides moderate insight into economic stability and social standing. Home ownership often indicates established families with community ties, while renting may suggest recent arrivals, transient workers, or economic hardship following the Great Depression."

  - name: farm_3_plus_acres
    column_number: 5
    data_type: string
    description: "house on farm of 3+ acres (Y/yes or blank/no)"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Offers limited value in distinguishing subsistence family farms from larger agricultural operations. This can indicate whether farming was a primary livelihood or supplementary activity."

  - name: agricultural_questionnaire
    column_number: 6
    data_type: string
    description: "Agricultural Questionnaire Number"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides minimal direct value but indicates the existence of a separate agricultural schedule that may contain detailed information about farm size, crops, livestock, and equipment."

  # Columns 7-12: Personal information
  - name: name
    column_number: 7
    data_type: string
    description: "Full name as written (last name first for head)"
    required: true
    genealogical_value: "The name field holds exceptional value as the primary identifier for locating and confirming individuals across records. Spelling variations, nicknames, and middle names can reveal family naming patterns, ethnic heritage, and connections to earlier generations. Comparing names across census years may expose anglicization of immigrant names, adoptions, remarriages, or clerical errors that explain apparent disappearances from records."

  - name: relationship
    column_number: 8
    data_type: string
    description: "Relationship to head of household"
    required: true
    abbreviations:
      "H": "Head"
      "W": "Wife"
      "S": "Son"
      "D": "Daughter"
    genealogical_value: "Provides exceptional value for reconstructing family structures and identifying biological, step, and in-law relationships. This field reveals household composition including extended family members, boarders, servants, or hired hands. Changes in relationship status across census years can indicate deaths of spouses, remarriages, children leaving home, or elderly parents moving in with adult children."

  - name: race
    column_number: 9
    data_type: string
    description: "W=White, Neg=Negro, Ind=Indian, Jp=Japanese, Ch=Chinese, Fil=Filipino"
    valid_values: ["W", "Neg", "Ind", "Jp", "Ch", "Fil"]
    required: true
    genealogical_value: "Offers moderate value for understanding social and historical context of ancestors' lives. Race classifications can reveal mixed-heritage families, point toward specialized record sets such as Freedmen's Bureau or tribal rolls, and explain geographic mobility patterns including the Great Migration or wartime relocations of Japanese Americans."

  - name: sex
    column_number: 10
    data_type: string
    description: "M=Male, F=Female"
    valid_values: ["M", "F"]
    required: true
    genealogical_value: "Provides moderate value primarily for confirming identity and distinguishing between individuals with similar names. This field helps identify gender-ambiguous names like Marion, Leslie, or Pat, and occasional enumeration errors may explain discrepancies when correlating records."

  - name: age
    column_number: 11
    data_type: integer
    description: "Age at last birthday"
    required: true
    genealogical_value: "Holds significant value for calculating approximate birth years and establishing identity across multiple records. Age discrepancies of 2-3 years between census records are common and normal, but larger variations may indicate different individuals, deliberate misreporting for employment or marriage purposes, or uncertainty about actual birth dates among immigrants or formerly enslaved persons."

  - name: marital_status
    column_number: 12
    data_type: string
    description: "M/Mar=Married, Wd=Widowed, D=Divorced, Sep=Separated, S/Nev=Single (never married)"
    valid_values: ["M", "Mar", "Married", "Wd", "Widowed", "D", "Div", "Divorced", "Sep", "Separated", "S", "Nev", "Single", "Never"]
    required: true
    genealogical_value: "Provides significant insight into life events and family circumstances. Widowed status indicates a death to research, divorced or separated status was relatively rare and may appear in court records, and changes from single to married between censuses narrow the search window for marriage records. Multiple marriages can be traced through status changes across decades."

  # Columns 13-14: Birthplace and citizenship
  - name: birthplace
    column_number: 13
    data_type: string
    description: "State if US-born, or country if foreign-born"
    required: true
    genealogical_value: "Holds exceptional value for tracing geographic origins and migration patterns across generations. For US-born individuals, birthplace reveals family movements between states and can point to earlier census records, vital records, or land records in those locations. For immigrants, birthplace identifies the country of origin for passenger list searches, naturalization records, and potentially foreign church or civil records."

  - name: naturalized
    column_number: 14
    data_type: string
    description: "Is person naturalized? Yes, No, AP for born-abroad to American parents"
    valid_values: ["Yes", "No", "AP", ""]
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides significant value for immigrant research by indicating whether naturalization papers exist in court records. Naturalization files often contain detailed biographical information including exact birthplace, arrival date, ship name, witnesses, and sometimes photographs. The AP designation for American Parents born abroad points toward overseas military or diplomatic records."

  # Columns 15-20: Employment status for persons 14+ years old
  - name: employment_status
    column_number: 15
    data_type: string
    description: "What person was doing most of last week: W=Working, H=Keeping house, Ot=Other"

    genealogical_value: "Provides minimal value but may indicate illness, injury, vacation, or seasonal employment patterns that affected family circumstances."

  - name: hours_worked
    column_number: 19
    data_type: integer
    description: "Hours worked last week"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Offers limited value in understanding work intensity and whether employment was full-time or part-time. Exceptionally long hours may indicate multiple jobs or seasonal harvest work, while short hours might suggest health issues or economic underemployment."

  - name: occupation
    column_number: 20a
    data_type: string
    description: "What kind of work (specific occupation)"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Holds exceptional value for understanding an ancestor's daily life, skills, and social standing. Occupations can reveal specialized training or education, point to union records or professional licensing documents, suggest health hazards that may have affected lifespan, indicate immigration patterns for particular trades, and connect families through shared occupations passed from parent to child. Comparing occupations across decades illuminates career progression, economic mobility, or hardship."

  - name: industry
    column_number: 20b
    data_type: string
    description: "What kind of business or industry"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides significant value by adding context to occupation data. Industry information can identify specific employers for personnel records, reveal exposure to workplace hazards relevant to health histories, and explain geographic choices when families moved to industrial centers, mining regions, or agricultural areas."

  - name: class_of_worker
    column_number: 20c
    data_type: string
    description: "P=Private wage/salary, G=Government, O=Own business, U=Unpaid family worker"
    valid_values: ["P", "G", "O", "U"]
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Offers moderate insight into economic independence and family business structures. Government workers may appear in civil service records, business owners might be found in tax records or business directories, and unpaid family workers reveal household economic contributions often overlooked in other records."

  # Sample line questions (sample lines vary by form version)
  # Columns 21-28: Residence and education
  - name: is_sample_person
    data_type: boolean
    description: "True if this is a sample person with additional questions"

    column_number: 32
    data_type: integer
    description: "Income from self-employment in 1949"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Provides significant insight into entrepreneurial activity and business ownership.

    column_number: 33
    data_type: integer
    description: "Income from other sources in 1949"
    required: false
    genealogical_value: "Offers moderate value by revealing additional income streams such as rental property, investments, pensions, or family support.

  1950 CENSUS FORM STRUCTURE:

  The 1950 census used two main form types: P1 (standard) and P3 (household form).
  Unlike 1940, it uses page numbers (not sheets A/B). Citations often use "stamp"
  instead of "page" for the page reference.

  =============================================================================
  FORM P1 - STANDARD POPULATION AND HOUSING SCHEDULE
  =============================================================================

  30 lines per page, one person per line.

  COLUMN LAYOUT - FOR ALL PERSONS (Cols 1-14):
  - Col 1: Street name
  - Col 2: House/apartment number
  - Col 3: Serial number of dwelling unit
  - Col 4: House on farm or ranch? (Y or blank)
  - Col 5: House on 3+ acres? (Y or blank)
  - Col 6: Agricultural Questionnaire number
  - Col 7: NAME - Last name first for head, given names follow
  - Col 8: Relationship to head (Head, Wife, Son, Daughter, Lodger, etc.)
  - Col 9: Race (W=White, Neg=Negro, Ind=Indian, etc.)
  - Col 10: Sex (M/F)
  - Col 11: Age at last birthday
  - Col 12: Marital status (M=Married, Wd=Widowed, D=Divorced, Sep=Separated, S=Single)
  - Col 13: Birthplace (state if US, country if foreign)
  - Col 14: Naturalization status (if foreign-born): Yes, No, AP

  COLUMN LAYOUT - FOR PERSONS 14+ (Cols 15-20):
  - Col 15: Employment status last week (W=Working, H=Keeping house, Ot=Other)
  - Col 16: Any work at all last week? (Y/N)
  - Col 17: Looking for work? (Y/N)
  - Col 18: Has job but not at work? (Y/N)
  - Col 19: Hours worked last week
  - Col 20: Occupation (20a), Industry (20b), Class of worker (20c)

  SAMPLE LINE QUESTIONS (Cols 21-33) - FORM P1 ONLY:
  Sample persons have additional questions. There were 5 versions of Form P1,
  each with different sample lines to randomize the ~20% sample:
    - Version A: Lines 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26
    - Version B: Lines 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27
    - Version C: Lines 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28
    - Version D: Lines 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29
    - Version E: Lines 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30

  IMPORTANT: Identify sample persons by checking for presence of columns 21-33
  data, NOT by line number (since form version cannot be determined from data).

  Sample line columns:
  - Col 21: Same house as April 1, 1949? (Y/N)
  - Col 22: On farm April 1, 1949? (Y/N)
  - Col 23: Same county April 1, 1949? (Y/N)
  - Col 24: If different, county/state/country
  - Col 25: Father's birthplace (25a), Mother's birthplace (25b)
  - Col 26: Highest grade of school attended
  - Col 27: Completed that grade? (Y/N)
  - Col 28: School attendance since February 1? (Y/N)
  - Col 29-33: Employment/income history (ages 14+)

  =============================================================================
  FORM P3 - HOUSEHOLD FORM (Experimental - Ohio and Michigan)
  =============================================================================

  Used experimentally in parts of Ohio and Michigan. Different structure:
  - Organized by HOUSEHOLD, not sequential line numbers
  - Each head of household has "Line Number 1"
  - Multiple households appear on the same page
  - Family relationships stored as explicit fields (Spouse, Child)
  - NO sample lines - everyone answers all questions

  IDENTIFYING HOUSEHOLD FORMS:
  - RootsMagic citations include "household form" in the source name
  - FamilySearch shows "Others on This Record" section for other households
  - Relationships shown as "Spouse: [Name]" and "Child: [Name]" fields

  EXTRACTION DIFFERENCES FOR HOUSEHOLD FORMS:
  - Cannot use line numbers to identify household boundaries
  - Must follow individual ARK links to get each person's full data
  - Family members grouped under target person, not by line sequence
  - Other households on same page shown in "Others on This Record" section

  CITATION FORMAT:
  Standard P1: "1950 U.S. census, [County], [State], [Township], E.D. [ED], stamp [N], line [line]"
  Household form: "1950 U.S. census, [County], [State], [Township], citing household form E.D. [ED], stamp [N]"

  =============================================================================
  IMPORTANT READING TIPS
  =============================================================================
  - First census released digitally (2022), image quality varies
  - Names use ditto marks for same surname as previous line
  - Rural areas may have descriptive addresses instead of street numbers
  - Watch for Sample line persons which have extra data on right side (cols 21-33)
  - Common abbreviations: Wm=William, Jno=John, Jas=James, Jr=Junior, Sr=Senior
